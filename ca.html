              <p>The retail price of regular petrol hit a three-figure mark for the first time across the country after it was hiked by 26 paise to Rs 100.13 a litre in Rajasthan’s Sri Ganganagar on Wednesday, while diesel got dearer by 27 paise to Rs 92.13, as per the data available on the Indian Oil Corporation’s website.

        <h5>ONE NATION ONE ELECTION</h5>
        <p>The prudency of the policy of ‘one nation, one election’ comes from the  point that due to frequent elections, a lot of money and man power is used and simultaneous elections would help saving the same. Also, it is expected that the number of voters actually coming out of their houses to vote would increase.</p>
        <p>one of the biggest arguments in the favour of the simultaneous elections is the fact that it would lighten the burden on the Government’s exchequer. If India chooses this system, it will help saving a huge amount of money. The maximum expenditure limit for bigger assemblies is ₹28 lacs. This means that if all the states & UTs go for 1-time election then the total cost would be around ₹11 billion. However presently around 5 states go for polls every year.</p>
