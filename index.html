              <h5>Dandi March</h5>
              <p> Salt production and distribution in India had long been a lucrative monopoly of the British. Through a series of laws, the Indian people was prohibited from producing or selling salt independently, and instead Indians were required to buy expensive, heavily taxed salt that often was imported. This affected the great majority of Indians, who were poor and could not afford to buy it. Indian protests against the salt tax began in the 19th century and remained a major contentious issue throughout the period of British rule of the subcontinent.

In early 1930 Gandhi decided to mount a highly visible demonstration against the increasingly repressive salt tax by marching through what is now the western Indian state of Gujarat from his ashram (religious retreat) at Sabermati (near Ahmadabad) to the town of Dandi (near Surat) on the Arabian Sea coast. He set out on foot on March 12, accompanied by several dozen followers.On the morning of April 6, Gandhi and his followers picked up handfuls of salt along the shore, thus technically “producing” salt and breaking the law.</p>

        <h5>ONE NATION ONE ELECTION</h5>
        <p>The prudency of the policy of ‘one nation, one election’ comes from the  point that due to frequent elections, a lot of money and man power is used and simultaneous elections would help saving the same. Also, it is expected that the number of voters actually coming out of their houses to vote would increase.</p>
        <p>one of the biggest arguments in the favour of the simultaneous elections is the fact that it would lighten the burden on the Government’s exchequer. If India chooses this system, it will help saving a huge amount of money. The maximum expenditure limit for bigger assemblies is ₹28 lacs. This means that if all the states & UTs go for 1-time election then the total cost would be around ₹11 billion. However presently around 5 states go for polls every year.</p>
